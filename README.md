# Surf_up

The purpose of this analysis.
The analysis used SQLAIchemy as one of the primary technologies to connect to the databases where databases are stored and is extremely helpful for querying databases.  A great feature of SQLAIchemy called create engine to set up the ability to query a SQLite database. We have our weather results saved in a variable. The data was saved in Python Pandas DataFrame to be accessed it in the future. A DataFrame variable, df, was created and used to query results, especially to retrieve all the differences in temperatures for the months of June and December.

Results

June Temperature
count	1700.000000
mean	74.944118
std	3.257417
min	64.000000
25%	73.000000
50%	75.000000
75%	77.000000
max	85.000000

December temperature
count	1517.000000
mean	71.041529
std	3.745920
min	56.000000
25%	69.000000
50%	71.000000
75%	74.000000
max	83.000000

The three major points from the two analysis are as follows:
A.  The count in June Temperature is 1700.000000, while the count	in December is 1517.000000. June was too high with a major difference in temperature of 183,000000.

B.  The mean in the month of June is 74.944118 and quite low in the month of December @ 71.041529 wirh a deficit of 3,902,589.
As you can see the desparity is quite large.

C.  The min recorded in the month of June is 64.000000, while the min in the month December was statistically 56.000000 making a disparity of 8,000,000

There is a high-level summary of the results and there are two additional queries to perform to gather more weather data for June and December.

Summary of Report

The results show that the low (minimum) temperature is 54 degrees, the high (maximum) temperature is 85 degrees, and the average temperature is approximately 71.7 degrees.  Judging by the logistics, you can see that there are highs as with count, the mean and the minimum. Again here is the summary of that report. The count in June Temperature is 1700.000000, while the count	in December is 1517.000000. June was too high with a major difference in temperature of 183,000000.  The mean in the month of June is 74.944118 and quite low in the month of December @ 71.041529 wirh a deficit of 3,902,589.
As you can see the desparity is quite large.   The min recorded in the month of June is 64.000000, while the min in the month December was statistically 56.000000 making a disparity of 8,000,000.  And to conclude I will reaiterate that the percentile of 25%, 50%, and 75% also have some disparirities but minimized.
